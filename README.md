# new-installation-script

I made this script to save time installing and configuring the same applications I always install and config whenever I make a new installation.

# What I use for my terminal

- [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

## Usage

You can use the script by running newarch.sh, like so:

```
git clone git@github.com:Muramasa95/new-installation-script.git
cd new-installation-script
sh newarch.sh
```

Note that, when prombt with a choice, pressing enter won't work, and you have to press y or n.
The script will do everything while you sit back, will give you some options to install further applications.
